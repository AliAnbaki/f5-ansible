Support
=======

The F5 Ansible modules are developed primarily with the REST API in mind. Due
to this requirement, we often take the approach that newer versions of BIG-IP
are those that are best supported.

The versions of BIG-IP that support these modules typicall start at version
12.0.0, but may require later versions than that depending on the REST
functionality that is needed by them.

Incentives
----------

Fortunately or unfortunately, the Ansible modules are not recognized by F5 as
a supported product at this time.

Due to this constraint, you could say that the maintainers of these modules
have limited resources to focus on these full time. We do our best though,
and offload many of the more mundane tasks to automation where possible.

With those constraints in mind, we hope you can see why we are not able to
focus more on older releases of BIG-IP. Consider these modules as an incentive
to upgrade your BIG-IP to a later version.
