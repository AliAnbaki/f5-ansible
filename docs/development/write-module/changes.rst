Collecting and Reporting Changes
================================

After comparing differences between sets of attributes, there are two points in a modules
execution where the developer may need to massage data. They are,

* Before they send the data to the API
* Before they report the data to the user

To help facilitate this difference, the module developers can make use of one, or both, of
the ``Changes`` classes that exist in a module. In this section, those classes will be
discussed in greater detail.
