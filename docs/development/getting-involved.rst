Getting involved
================

So you want to get involved with this project. Great!

Becomming involved in this project can take a variety of angles. The
maintainers spend their time camping this repository as well as contributing
upstream to the Ansible core product. We can be reached on either forum.

Before you jump feet first in to coding, let me give you some idea of the
workload involved in module development. This is not intended to scare
you away, but only to set your expectations.

What is expected from you
-------------------------

First and foremost, we expect you to *bring a good attitude*. These modules
are developed out of our own personal interests in Ansible; there is
no official team here.

With that said, we want to keep the environment from getting bogged down
in a bad mood.

The development of a module will require some effort on your part. Often
times the countless reviews might seem frustrating, but believe us, we do
it for good reason.

By becomming involved with developing a module, you're accepting that your
contribution will probably not be accepted right off the bat. If you're
willing to work with us though, and understand the direction we're headed
in, you will more than likely find your module landing here.

We expect that you *stay up to date* with the documentation of this site
concerning module development. As time goes on, things change and new
practices are adopted. As this happens, we try to keep the documentation
up to date with these changes.

If you develop a module use an out-of-date convention, we will tell you
so upon review. It is then expected that you take the initiative to fix
it.

You must be *willing to accept maintenance of the module*. When we deem
that the module meets our expectations, we will open a PR with Ansible
and work to get the module merged into the core product.

Part of Ansible's requirements for this is that the people listed in
the author field (usually those who wrote the module) take responsibility
for the ongoing maintenance and support of the module.

Understandably this might be a big issue for you, so we are offering to
assist. When your module is merged to our repo here, we will add a
modification to the module that lists ourselves as one of the authors
of the code.

With this in place, and with the addition of us opening the PR with Ansible
upstream, we think this will be sufficient to meet their needs for ongoing
maintenance. This is a joint effort though, so lets work together to ensure
that the module stays in Core. Modules that can no longer be supported
by their authors are removed from Ansible.

What to work on
---------------

While module development is the primary focus of most contributors, we
are also open to accepting documentation efforts, additions to our test
runner, new ideas for modules, and other bug finding efforts.

Also, we take ideas for new Ansible roles that have a focus on BIG-IP/IQ.

You may have seen some of the BIG-IP roles on Ansible Galaxy or in the
f5devcentral Github organization; yup that's our work too.

This repo here is the foundational work that supports those other efforts.
We want to see this be a success though, and for the role landscape to grow
with the module landscape. So opening Issues here for new Role ideas is also
a great way to contribute.

One final thing that will require effort on your part that, frankly, we
cannot help with is that of endorsement.

The Ansible work here is by no means supported by F5. If you want that to
change, then you will need to initiate that change. Speaking with your SEs,
AMs, SAs, etc etc, is the best way to drive that change.

When we run our mouths about orchestration tools, it falls on deaf ears.
If this is valuable to your organization, then say so.
